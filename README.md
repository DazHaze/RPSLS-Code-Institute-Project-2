Website - [Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock](https://dazhaze.github.io/RPSLS-Code-Institute-Project-2/)

## What is this website for?

This website is being created to demonstrate my knowledge of JavaScript and manipulating the DOM after my second module in CodeInstitute.

## Goal of this website

The aim of this website is to create an interesting game using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

### *Goals*
* Interesting game for the user.
* Succesful game loop with win and lose conditions.
* logic that does not break no matter what the user selects.
* correct use of Javascript.

### *Features for the next stage.*
* Patterns in the computer play that the user can learn.
* CSS styling effects that can give the user more feedback for in-game events.

## Existing Features.

* Clear UI
    * Minimal text is key for a small mini-game like this one. The user has to intuitivly know what to do in order to play the game. This is why the UI is bold and clear for a great user experience. Below is an example of clear UI where the user choices are displayed as images. On desktop, while the mouse is hovered over the image is scaled up and a color is eased in. This indicates that this element can be clicked.

    * When the user selects a choice, their choice is displayed along with the computers choice.

    * Even though this is a simple game I thought it was important for the user to have some choice in what they are playing. This is why the game-type section was included. This provides the user with a choice between; First to five games or first to three games. The user can also reset the game.

    * As seen in the image above a fun little message is also displayed for the user when the round is over.
